# MINI-ATM
Implemented an ATM system using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, focusing on user-friendly and secure features. The project incorporated the following functionalities:

Check Balance:
Users can easily check their account balance at the ATM, providing instant access to their financial information.
Cash Withdrawal:
Enabling users to withdraw cash from the ATM, this functionality includes validation to ensure that the entered withdrawal amount is less than the available account balance.
User Details:
The system allows users to view and cross-check their account details with the bank, providing a convenient way to verify and update personal information.
Update Mobile Number:
Users have the ability to update the mobile number linked to their bank account, ensuring that their contact information remains up to date.

Implemented in a collaborative team environment, the project involved thorough testing to ensure functionality, security, and a seamless user experience.
